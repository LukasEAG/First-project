# Event Production Website

Hi, my name is ≈Åukasz and I'm trying to become Frontend-Developer.

This is my next project of creating webpage without using tutorials. The graphic design was provided by the client. 

## Guidelines for the project:

### The client requests that his website:

- was created and carefully reproduced based on a mock-up,
- it was made professionally, just like other websites of serious companies (the client doesn't know anything about technical things, so he trusts you to do everything perfectly),
- have slide gallery image,
- have your own script written in JS for the hamburger menu,
- some version of scroll-spy is also welcome,
- have contact form,
- have the option to choose the language
  

### Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS (Sass/BEM)
- JavaScript
- Node.js
